In some cases it can be useful to have the possibility to use the functions and methods of the **Multisite Language Switcher** in a direct way.

**Before you proceed: Backup your files and database prior to trying any of these examples here, better safe than sorry.**

> *If you just look for further examples of how to integrate the plugin or intact with its functionality, then head over  [to this page]({{site.url}}/integration-snippets-and-examples).*

## the\_msls ##

This function can be placed anywhere in your theme-files such as _header.php_, _footer.php_ and _sidebar.php_. It will echo an output similar to the widget.

    if ( function_exists ( 'the_msls' ) ) {
        the_msls();
    }
    
You can also use some parameters to format the output to suit your needs.

    if ( function_exists ( 'the_msls' ) ) {
        $args = array(
            'before_item'   => '<li>',
            'after_item'    => '</li>',
            'before_output' => '<ul>',
            'after_output'  => '</ul>',
        );
        the_msls( $args );
    }

*This would create the output formatted in an unordered list.*

## get\_the\_msls ##

Use this function if a string is needed because your theme handles the output in a different way, for example.

    $str = '';
    if ( function_exists ( 'get_the_msls' ) ) {
        $str = get_the_msls();
    }

**get\_the\_msls** accepts the same parameters as **the\_msls**.

## MslsOutput ##

All these functions use an object type of __MslsOutput__. The magic method '\_\_toString' handles all needs when this object is printed. But you can use the 'get'-method directly if you want to work - for example - with the returning array of links before it is converted:

    $object  = new MslsOutput();
    $display = 0;
    $exists  = false;
 
    foreach ( $object->get( $display, $exists ) as $link ) {
        echo $link;
    }

The parameter _$display_ is an integer which can contain any number from 0 to 4. There is a static method in the class *MslsLink* which is used in a similar way in the option-page of the plugin:

    print_r( MslsLink::get_types() );

If you want to show links to existing translations only set the parameter _$exists_ to _true_.
